# Welcome to NTJJ Mak's STAT 545 Homework Page

## About Me

 1. I have lived and studied in three cities: Saskatoon, Montreal, and Vancouver.
 2. I like Brookly Nine-Nine and it is one of the two reasons why I have a very neglected Twitter account.
 3. I love podcasts. Highly recommend: CBC's The Debaters, NPR's Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me, and PodSave America.

### Font styles
Let's look at a list of different font styles
  * **bold**
  * *italics*
  * ~~strikethrough~~
  * `code`
    * Note: fenced code blocks (see below) is an option to inline `code`

Now let's mix it up! ***bold italics*** ***bold italics ~~strikethrough~~***

### Emojis
Emojis are made by surrounding the name with colons. For example: `:thumbsup:`
:thumbsup:


### Tables
Let's make a table of emojis for future reference.

|Emoji | `Code`|
---|---
|:smiley:| `:smiley:`|
|:wink:| `:wink:`|
|:sleepy:| `:sleepy:`|
|:zzz:| `:zzz:`|
|:blush:| `:blush:`|


### Fenced code blocks

```
This is me exploring fenced code blocks.

Keep reading the ReadMe to see Blockquotes and Task Lists

### Blockquotes
This weekend I watched
\#GuardiansoftheGalaxy\
It was great, but the only quote I can think of is:
> I am Groot! :evergreen_tree:
